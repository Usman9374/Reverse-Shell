# Reverse-Shell
For my Information Security project, I built a Python-based reverse shell using sockets and NGROK. It connects a victimâ€™s device back to an attacker's server, enabling remote access. This taught me about security vulnerabilities, ethical hacking, and defenses like firewalls, IDS, and endpoint protection.
